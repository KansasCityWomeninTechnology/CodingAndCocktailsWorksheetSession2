# Grouping & Selectors {#top}
CSS allows you to be as generic or as specific as you want. In this section we will learn how to apply styles to multiple selectors and work with special selectors.

This section will help guide you through the following steps:
{% include "./instruction-steps.html" %}

## Set default color for all header text {#header-colors} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Setting a style on multiple selectors at once makes CSS succinct. In this section you'll set a default color for all header text.
{% include "./1header-colors.md" %}

## Change hover color of hyperlinks using pseudo classes {#hover} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Providing user feedback on clickable elements such as hyperlinks is thoughtful user interaction. You'll set a hover color, style lists, and practice CSS organization.
{% include "./2hover-color.md" %}

## Using list pseudo classes and combinators to style lists {#lists} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
We'll work some more with list styling and add spacing between list elements.
{% include "./3list-item-space.md" %}

## Checkpoint <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Compare your _styles.css_ against the answer key for your work so far. It might look a little different depending on the color palette you chose.  
{% include "./checkpoint.html" %}
