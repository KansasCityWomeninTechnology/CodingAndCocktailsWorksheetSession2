## Helpful tips as you work through the worksheet
{% hint style='tip' %}
View the worksheet and your IDE in split screen. 

For Windows users, use `windows key` + `left arrow` or `windows` + `right arrow` to resize the application and position to the left or right half of your screen.

For Mac users, hold down the full-screen button in the upper-left corner of a window to shrink and position to the left or right side of the screen. Release the button, then click another window to begin using both windows side by side.

Mentors are happy to help!
