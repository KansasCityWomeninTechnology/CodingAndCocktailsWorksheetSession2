# Project

We'll start out trying some basic CSS styling in Part 1 to get some practice and learn how to make the page look nicer.  From there we'll start trying out Sass to work through styling a sample page.  Weâ€™ll translate utilize Sass variables, mixins and nesting to make our development easier!
