# Project

In order to compare the differences between CSS and Sass we’re going to work through styling a sample page.  First we’ll add CSS styling to get a bit of practice and make it pretty.  Then we’ll translate the CSS into Sass utilizing variables, mixins and nesting to make our development easier!
