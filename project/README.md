# Project

We'll start out trying some basic CSS styling in Part 1 to get some practice and learn how to make the page look better.  From there we'll start trying out Sass - a CSS Compiler - to work through styling a sample page more efficiently.  We’ll utilize Sass variables, mixins and nesting to make our development easier!


# Prep Work {#prep-work}  

1.  Open your command line terminal (Git Bash on Windows, iTerm2 on Macs) and type the command:  `gem install sass`

    Output should look similar to :

    ![](/images/image02.png)

1.  Check that you’ve got everything installed by typing:  `sass -v`

 Output should look like this:

    ![](/images/image04.png)
