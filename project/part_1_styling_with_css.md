### Part 1:  Styling with CSS {#part-1-styling-with-css}

1.  Choose a color palette from [colorhunt.co](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://colorhunt.co/&sa=D&ust=1478381675849000&usg=AFQjCNEXcVJYXfFWdPSAFyEoq4PM_tnBMQ) and make note of the color hex values (the #XXXXXX that displays when you hover over the color) to use as the colors in your project.  You can also just use the one we selected: [colorhunt.co/c/3986](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://colorhunt.co/c/3986&sa=D&ust=1478381675850000&usg=AFQjCNHw0H2Makp2pEbucw5vRFceZ5uDFQ) 

2.  Scroll through the list of fonts on google webfonts ([google.com/fonts](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/fonts&sa=D&ust=1478381675851000&usg=AFQjCNHzwozQ7Hn7o5A8kVzLbdZlrw_aEQ)) and choose two fonts that you like and look nice together for your website or use the fonts we selected: Montserrat &amp; Neuton. Fonts can be imported by inserting the following code in your CSS file:

`@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat|Neuton);`

  Typically websites will include a serif font for the body and a sans-serif for the headers.

   a. Click the blue “Add to Collection button” on the right of each one you want to use
   
   b. At the bottom of the page click on the “Use” button.
   
   c. Leave just the “Normal” box checked and scroll down to step 3 “Add this code to your website:”
   
   d. Click on the import tab and copy that code and paste it in the top of your CSS file.

3.  Fork the **CSSCompilerPractice** repository ([bit.ly/CnCCmp](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/CnCCmp&sa=D&ust=1478381675854000&usg=AFQjCNErZXRWwUn85j0f3ZhjdLCZzoC6Cw)) to your own account

4.  Clone the repository to your computer using Git Bash or iTerm2

5.  Open the **index.html** file in Google Chrome.  It doesn’t look very nice, does it?  Let’s add some styling!

6.  Open the CSSCompilerPractice folder in Sublime Text.  Add CSS to the **styles.css** file to style your page.  Reference the CSS cheat sheet below for some of the commonly used CSS properties if you need a refresher or try googling things!
