###Body Styling

1. In the project pane on the left, right click on the sass folder and select `New File`. 

2. Type `_main.scss` and press enter. This will be the partial file where the styling for the main body portion of our page will be located.

3. Don't forget to import main into your _styles.scss_ file.

2.  Start with styling the main “hero” image and text with the large page heading, a smaller “tagline” and some about text.

    1. Select the `.hero` class.
    
    2. Give it a `height:` and a `width:`.  A `600px;` height should work well. It should cover `100%;` of the width of the page.
    
    3. Instead of having an `<img>` HTML element here to display the image, we'll be using a background image on our div.  

3.  Style a product list

4.  Style the sidebar Customer Favorites content to display on the right side
