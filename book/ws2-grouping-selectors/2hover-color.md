1. Select a color that displays when your mouse hovers over the hyperlink tags in your navigation bar and footer.
1. Create a style targeting the hover Pseudo Class on the `a` tag within `nav` and define the `background-color` property. Your code should look similar to this.
    
    {% filename %}styles.css{% endfilename %}
    ```css
    nav a:hover {
        background-color: #d88731;
    }
    ```
    {% hint style='tip' %}
Group styles for the same parent element together to make it easier for yourself. Group all the `nav` style together, but order by specificity.
    {% endhint %}
    Save your file and view in Chrome. What happens when you hover over the links in the navigation bar?

1. We don't want the bullets to show in the navigation menu. Remove the bullets by setting the `list-style-type` property to "none" on the `ul` tag in `nav`. Your code should look like this.

    {% filename %}styles.css{% endfilename %}
    ```css
    nav ul {
        list-style-type: none;
    }
    ```
    Save your file and view in Chrome. The navigation bar is starting to look better.

1. Repeat the steps in the section by adding the hover color and removing the bullets in the `footer`. Be sure to put these styles towards the bottom of the page with your footer background color.
