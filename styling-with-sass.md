###Variables
Start by creating some Sass variables that will represent the colors in the color palette that you selected earlier.

1. If needed, open the _variables.scss file by double clicking on it in the left pane. 
    
2. Create your first variable for the main color of your site. Variables start with a `$` followed by the variable name.  It might look something like the following:
    
    ```
    $pink: #F9A1BC;
    ```
    
3. Create variables for the remaining colors in your site.  It is common to name your color variables according the color name.  Things like `$turquoise`, `$white`, `$dark-purple`, etc.
