# Box Model & Layout {#top}
Cluttered web pages overload the brain. Spacing and layout helps draw attention to different parts of the website by making it easier for users to "see". We will continue our work on LadyDev Bar & Grill by applying spacing and layout concepts.

This section will help guide you through the following steps:
{% include "./checklist.html" %}

## Define section boundaries with borders {#borders} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Borders help define sections and helps the user by grouping like items together. You will explore different border properties to bring definition to your webpage.
{% include "./1borders.md" %}

## Use the Box Model to add padding and margins  {#padding-margin} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
The Box Model is use to define spacing. You will apply Box Model concepts to add whitespace to LadyDev Bar & Grill.
Refer to the [CSS Cheat Sheet](../references/css_cheat_sheet.md) to help.
{% include "./2padding-margin.md" %}

## Define a background image to use for the hero image {#hero} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Most eye-catching websites have a hero image. Letâ€™s learn about background properties and use what we learned about absolute and relative sizing and apply it to the hero image.
{% include "./3hero.md" %}

## Use CSS grid for layout {#grid-layout} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
We want the drink menu and small plates menu as two columns next to each other. We will use CSS Grid to make this easy.
{% include "./4grid-layout.md" %}
