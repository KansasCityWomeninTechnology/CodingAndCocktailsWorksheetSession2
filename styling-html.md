#Styling HTML

1. In CodePen, notice we've set up some HTML for you to practice styling.  There is already page structure content in the first box with the HTML heading.

2. In the middle box with the CSS heading, select the `body` element and change the `background-color` to one from your selected color palette.

3. Select the element with the id `#main-title`.
    
    1. Change the `font-family` to the font you selected from google fonts.
    
    2. Increase the size of the text to be four times the size of the HTML (root) font-size. 
    
    3. Change the `color` to another color hex value from your chosen color palette.

    4. Center the header text using the `text-align` property.

4. Select the `img` element.

    1. Change the height of the image to `100px`.
    
    2. Change the width of the image to `200px`.
       
       Notice how this distorts the image so when you are styling an image make sure to keep an eye to how your styling affects the image. 

5. Select the `.section` class and change the `background-color` to another color within your chosen palette.

    Notice how the div sections don't stretch to meet the edges of the page body or eachother
    
6. Select the first section with the `.section-one` class
    
    1. Add a border that is 5 pixels wide and solid using another of the colors from your chosen palette.
    
    2. Margin & Padding
