1. In Atom, right click on the "CSS" project folder and create a new folder named "css" to house your stylesheet.
   {% hint style='danger' %}
Notice the case difference in "CSS" folder that contains all your code this session and "css" folder that contains your styles. 
	{% endhint %}

1. Right click on the "css" folder and create a file for your stylesheet. Name the file _styles.css_.
1. In Atom, open _index.html_. In the `head` section, between the `title` and `script` tags, link your stylesheet by adding 

   `<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">`
1. Save your file.
1. Open your _index.html_ file in Google Chrome and notice the current styling.  

    {% hint style='tip' %}
There's 2 different ways to open the file in Chrome. 
	
In Chrome, you can select **File** <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> **Open File**. Navigate to your "CodingAndCocktails\CSS" folder and open the _index.html_ file. You can also use the keyboard shortcut `ctrl` + `o` on Windows machines.

Or you can navigate to "CodingAndCocktails\CSS" folder, right click on the _index.html_ file and choose **Open with**. Select Google Chrome from the list.
	{% endhint %}
