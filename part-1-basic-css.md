#Part 1: Basic CSS

We'll start with some sample HTML and get a chance to try out changing some styles to start getting comfortable with how CSS works.

##Preparation
1. Navigate to the CSS Practice CodePen at  [http://codepen.io/CodingCocktailsKC/pen/PWjRzG](http://codepen.io/CodingCocktailsKC/pen/PWjRzG)

2. Once you are logged in to your account, press the Fork button in the top right.

3. Pick out a color palette that you like to use from [http://colorhunt.co](http://colorhunt.co).

    1. Make note of the hex color values displayed when you hover over each color in your chosen palette.
    
5. Navigate to Google Fonts at https://fonts.google.com/

6. Scroll through the fonts and choose one font that you like.
    
    1. Click the red `+` in the upper right of that font's section
    2. At the bottom of your page, a box with the text `1 Family Selected` will appear.  
    3. Click on the `1 Family Selected` section
    4. Copy the text in the grey box under the `STANDARD` heading
    5. Back in CodePen, paste the copied `link` tag text just above the `</head>` tag.

You now have the information you'll need when styling your page, continue on to change the styling.
